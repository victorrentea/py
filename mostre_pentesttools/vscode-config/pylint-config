# Python expression which should return a score less than 10 (10 is the highest score). You have access to the variables
# errors warning, statement which respectively contain the number of errors / warnings messages and the total number
# of statements analyzed. This is used by the global evaluation report (RP0004).
# Default: 10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)
#
# we increased the value of a error in order to considerably lower the score
evaluation=10.0 - ((float(100 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)
